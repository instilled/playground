# Playground

This is an example project trying to wire together and try things that I like:

* Clojure
* Java8 features (Streams, default interface methods, ...)
* JBoss stack (Resteasy, Weld, ...)
* CDI Events
* JOOQ
* YAML backed configuration
* Gradle (yet to come)

This will eventually end up in a procjet template.
